PNA Rust Lesson plan - Course completion.

KVS is a key-value database built as part of the mentioned rust course.
It has following features - 
* CLI
* Log-structured File I/O
* Client-Server networking
* Custom protocol
* Multi-threading, async

Future scope (above and beyond the course) -
* Data replication across nodes in the cluster (distributed db)
* Fault tolerance
* Data consistency
* Anything that excites the crap out of me
